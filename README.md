A plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory using the Exiled framework.

## üîß Features

- If an SCP player leaves early, human players can **volunteer** to replace them
- SCPs can **request to become Spectators or Humans** with `.spectator` and `.human` commands
- If no one volunteers, a **random D-Class** can be selected (configurable)
- Optionally force SCP role change even if no replacement exists
- Fully customizable broadcast messages
- SCP roles can be **blacklisted** from being replaced
